// THE CAPTURE GEOMETRY, stated once so the asserts below have something to
// check against.
//
// One DMA block is MIC_BUFFER_SAMPLES; one Opus frame is
// CODEC_PACKAGE_SAMPLES. 1600 / 160 = 10 EXACTLY, and that integer ratio is
// the only reason a DMA block boundary and an Opus frame boundary re-align on
// every single block instead of drifting. Nothing in this firmware states
// that, and nothing checked it — so a future tuning pass that made the mic
// buffer 1500 samples would produce audio that still encodes, still transmits
// and is progressively wrong at the seams, with no build failure and no
// runtime error to point at. Omi carries the same ratio (100 ms blocks, 20 ms
// frames, exactly 5) and its own teardown calls it load-bearing and
// undocumented. The asserts live beside the buffers they protect, in codec.c
// and transport.c, because that is where the mistake would be made.
